# WikiLinkScapper

**This program is a web scraper designed to begin with one wikipedia page
and follow the first x numbered link to other wikipedia pages y number of times.**

Demo can be found here: https://youtu.be/hTVn4e_vLzo


PS: This program began as an attempt to familiarize myself with the bs4 & requests library in python which is why I have such terrible variable names. If you download the code and want to make changes, I would recommend using find and replace to quickly change variable names to something more meaningful.
